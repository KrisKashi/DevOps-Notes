# What I did 

- Uploaded an existing python project to github
- Initialised git repo for the project
- Created a ".gitignore" to avoid committing sensitive/environment  files
- Made a commit and pushed to github

# Commands 

- git init 
- git add .
-  git commit -m "coingecko-api-project"
-  git branch -M main
- git remote add origin
- gish push -u origin main 

# Risk Management 

- Security risks can arise if sensitive data is committed (API key)
- .gitignore is cruical before push
